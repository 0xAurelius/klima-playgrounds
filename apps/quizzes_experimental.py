                            Klima DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization to drive climate action,
                            via our carbon-backed, algorithmic currency- the KLIMA token.
                            As the protocol grows, Klima DAO will solve the critical problems of the carbon markets:
                            -  Illiquidity: Carbon Credits come in many different varieties; carbon brokers and
                            middlemen are used by buyers and sellers, fragmenting the total liquidity of the market.
                            - Opacity: Trades occur often behind closed doors, allowing buyers to underbuy the market.
                            - Inefficiency: buying and retiring carbon credits comes with friction and barriers,
                            by utilizing the polygon ecosystem, it removes this friction for all users
                            In delivery of its objectives, Klima DAO will become the single biggest disruptor of the
                            carbon markets and set a precedent for a new monetary system backed by carbon.
                            Klima DAO will serve the web3 ecosystem by offering accountability for those that
                            contribute, rewards for stakeholders, and a stake in governance for those that participate.
                            Klima DAO was inspired by Olympus DAO. It was conceptualized and built by a
                            distributed pseudo-anonymous team.
                            Klima is DAO-governed by it's community. All decisions are formed by community members on
                             the forum and made by KLIMA holders through snapshot voting.

                            1. Driven Climate Action:
                            Klima DAO incentivizes new supply of Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) on the blockchain
                            through the KLIMA token. By driving demand into BCT, it incentivizes carbon offset
                            producers to produce more carbon credits, assisting the adoption of new carbon mitigating
                            or sequestering technology, and disincentivizes companies wanting to offset their carbon
                            footprint with only C.Cs, and forces them to perform environmentally friendly actions.
                            KLIMA is the first building block for unlocking the carbon economy â€” an economy where more
                            economic activity leads to an acceleration in planetary regeneration rather than more
                            amage to our planet. Before, monetary incentives and environmental incentives aren't
                            typically aligned.
                            2. Become a Carbon-Based Reserve Currency:
                            The KLIMA ecosystem and monetary policy are managed by the Klima DAO.
                            This way we guarantee transparent decision making and long-term stability.
                            In the long term, we can use this system to optimize stability, to transition to a global
                            unit of account and medium of exchange. Currently, in the short term, we're focused on
                            growth and wealth creation, to incentivize users to join the new wave of carbon currency.
                            3. Facilitate the Climate Market:
                            The current carbon (and the climate in general) markets are illiquid, fragmented,
                            inefficient, and opaque. Because of this, we feel that carbon tonnage is heavily
                             undervalued, and is forced down because of these issues. By eliminating these issues,
                             the true price can be achieved.

                              via the Toucan Protocol. Bonders provide BCT LP or BCT tokens in exchange for discounted
                              KLIMA tokens after a fixed vesting period. Once KLIMA tokens are held, stakers stake
                              their KLIMA tokens in return for more KLIMA tokens.

                            KLIMA is an algorithmic carbon-backed currency,
                            inspired by [Olympus DAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) and their token mechanics.
                            KlimaDAO incentivises new supply of Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) on the blockchain through
                            bonding with the Protocol. Each KLIMA token is backed at a 1:1 ratio with a BCT in the
                            treasury.
                            KlimaDAO leverages the [Toucan Protocol's](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/)
                            Carbon Bridge to retire real world Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) and convert them to a
                            tokenized form on the blockchain, VCUs can be verified from reputable carbon markets in a
                            transparent and traceable manner.Â  The credits are then absorbed through the protocols'
                            bonding mechanism, building a treasury of verified tokenized carbon reductions.
                            This increases the amount of carbon assets locked within the treasury, thereby
                            reducing supply on the open market and leading to price appreciation within the
                            Voluntary Carbon Markets.
                            In summary, Klima serves two main purposes:
                            1. It serves as a floating currency and a form of money backed at a 1:1 ratio by voluntary
                            carbon credits.
                            2. It is used to govern the protocol and confer voting power to influence decisions on
                            various policies including supply expansion mechanics.
